/*
The following code is for a small business called Buzz Buttons who 
create novelty lapel buttons for customers.
Customers input some basic information about themselves and their
order, and the program calculates their total costs (tax, shipping, etc.)

Unfortunately, this code has not yet been code reviewed.
Please work with a group of other coders to go through this code and
review it.

You are looking for things like typos, unclear instructions to the user, 
logic errors in the code, syntax errors, etc.

You might want to try running the code to find some of these errors,
but be warned that running the code won't catch everything!
You should also carefully read the comments to make sure the code 
reflects the intention of the coder.

Here is some test data you can use to test your code:
Input 525 buttons:
	Total for buttons: 	519.75
	Sales Tax:			31.18
	Shipping:			2.00
	Order Total:		552.93

Good luck! :)
